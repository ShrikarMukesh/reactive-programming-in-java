# reactive-programming-in-java
Reactive Programming is a programming language with asynchronous data stream.Once an event will raise it will react with responsive and non-blocking manner
thatâ€™s why it named it as reactive programming. <br/>

--> It is new programming paradigm <br/>
--> Asynchronous and non blocking <br/>
--> Event/message driven <br/>
--> Functional code style <br/>
--> Back Pressure on data streams <br/>
